There are some dummy files in the folder "lib". They are there to keep track of earlier approach .
To run the code on emulator or mobile
	First install all the dependencies and you have to configure the app for firebase 		authentication or ping me with your sha1 keys and I will do it for you.
	Then install the sdk and dependencies as required by the app.
	After this use "flutter run lib/mainc.dart" and the app will run.
	So to keep track of used files track it through mainc.dart file.
